# CS50 Projects
Several CS50 and CS50W Projects I really enjoyed during the courses.

## [Credit](https://github.com/belamotive/CS50_projects/tree/credit)
A program (in C) that prompts the user for a credit card number and with Luhn’s Algorithm reports (via printf) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number.

Example:
``` C
$ ./credit
Number: 4003-6000-0000-0014
Number: foo
Number: 4003600000000014
VISA
```

## [Tournament](https://github.com/belamotive/CS50_projects/tree/Tournament)
A program (in Python) that simulates a number of tournaments and outputs each team’s probability of winning. Using FIFA ratings (.csv), it simulates a tournament by repeatedly simulating rounds until just one team left.

Example:
``` Python
$ python tournament.py 2018m.csv
Belgium: 20.9% chance of winning
Brazil: 20.3% chance of winning
Portugal: 14.5% chance of winning
Spain: 13.6% chance of winning
Switzerland: 10.5% chance of winning
Argentina: 6.5% chance of winning
England: 3.7% chance of winning
France: 3.3% chance of winning
Denmark: 2.2% chance of winning
Croatia: 2.0% chance of winning
Colombia: 1.8% chance of winning
Sweden: 0.5% chance of winning
Uruguay: 0.1% chance of winning
Mexico: 0.1% chance of winning
```

## [Final Project](https://github.com/belamotive/CS50_projects/tree/final_project)
Web-based weather forecast application for people how likes to fish. It has all the data you need for fishing such as air pressure, moon illumination, wind speed and much more. It is based on a previous project that I created prior to this course during the summer of 2020.
